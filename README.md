# Help After Uri - HackUTD 2021 Submission
A web application made to help Texans recover from the February Snow Storm

## Motivation

Many Texans were negatively impacted by the February Snow Storm and did not have access to food, electricity, and warm clothes.

## What the application aims to solve

- Give Texans a way to ask others for help via the task completion system.
- Award those that helped out someone by giving them points that could be redeemed for prizes.
